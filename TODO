Critical:
-Logic System

Major:
-Camera as an entity
-Entities description (what collision model to use, what model to use, what shader to use, etc).
-Input System
-HUD

Minor:
-Deleting entities.
-Replace handles with simple ids
-Animation System

Trivial:
-Getting rid of that double floor model.

As always:
-Cleanup.
-Clean that code up.
-Make it clean.
