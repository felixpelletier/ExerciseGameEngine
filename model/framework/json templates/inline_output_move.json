/*
 * Move actions in inline cutscenes should be fairly rare, if present at all. Note that there's
 * no template for camera changes in inline cutscenes. IGNORE ANY CAMERA CHANGE TEMPLATES DURING
  * AN INLINE CUTSCENE!
 * 
 * You can always assume that if the subject has not been loaded in, the animation and
 * destination are a bit moot. You can just place them directly at the destination if you want.
 *
 * Note that speed of movement is not bound here. I hope to have speed bound to the
 * animation, but don't know enough about animations to really say.
