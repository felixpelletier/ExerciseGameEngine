/*
 * The lists of strings represent all selectable elements, eg "Buy", "Sell", "Quit". A 'level'
 * of menu represents how many presses the player made to arrive at a given list. For example:
 *
 * ["Buy", "Sell", "Quit"]
 * >> Player selects "Buy"
 * ["Buy", "Sell", "Quit"], ["Weapons", "Armour", "Booze"]
 * >> Player selects "Armour"
 * ["Buy", "Sell", "Quit"], ["Weapons", "Armour", "Booze"], ["Scale Mail", "Leather Armour", "Full Plate Armour"]
 * etc...
 *
 * All levels leading to the current one are returned since we assume we most often will
 * want to show the player his shop tree path.
