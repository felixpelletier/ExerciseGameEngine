"Fool":"The Fool represents a Man on a quest of fulfilment. His future is uncertain and the task ahead of him is great, but with a Fool's luck, and ignorance, he marches blissfully onwards. The Fool's card consists of a man standing dangerously close to the edge of a cliff, a dog yapping at his heels and a bulging sack containing all the elements he would need for his journey. As the arcana of infinite potential, it is usually a Persona of this arcana that the protagonist obtains at the start of his journey.\n\nThe Fool symbolizes:\n\tBeginnings\n\tInnocence\n\tNaivety",
"Magician":"The Magician is commonly associated with action, initiative, self-confidence, manipulation and power (more specifically, the power to harness one's talents).

"Priestess":"Portrayed as an old woman with a closed book, the Priestess Arcana is a symbol of hidden knowledge or other untapped power, wisdom, female mystery and magic. This arcana goes well with female characters with uncertainty in their hearts and immense or unique powers that are not often shown. According to the Megami Tensei Wikipedia page, \"Individuals associated with the Priestess Arcana are usually quiet, reserved, and very intelligent. They are often modest and shy, and won't open up to the protagonist until much later in their Social Links as compared with other characters\".\n\nThe Priestess symbolizes:\n\tHidden power\n\tWisdom\n\tIntuition",
"Empress":"The Empress represents mothers, prosperity, creativity, sexuality, abundance, fertility and comfort (most often in helping maintain peace around them like an ideal mother would). Once again typically female in character, the Empress wishes for balance. A person who wishes for justice to be served and to \"live happily ever after\", and is willing to face their responsibilities in order to bring it about. According to Nyx: \"Celebrate life's grandeur...its brilliance...its magnificence...\".The Empress symbolizes:\n\tSexuality\n\tLeadership\n\tProsperity",
"Emperor":"The Emperor symbolizes the desire to control one's surroundings, and its appearance could suggest that one is trying too hard to achieve this, possibly causing trouble for others; some elements in life are just not controllable. The card shows a King surrounded by riches and symbols of power, showing his never-ending thirst for it. A person representing the Emperor will usually be or wish to be in a position of power, causing either himself or others to question why he is there.\n\nThe Emperor symbolizes:\n\tPower\n\tControl\n\tImposingness",
"Hierophant":"The Hierophant is a symbol of education, authority, conservatism, obedience to rules and relationship with the divine.

The Hierophant social link will depict someone much older than the protagonist, who will be in his teens.\n\nThe Hierophant symbolizes:\n\tAuthority\n\tPast\n\tWisdom",
"Lovers":"The Lovers arcana initially represented two paths life could lead to, and thus a symbol of standing at a crossroad and needing to make a decision. Today, however, it is portrayed more of a symbol of love and romantic relationships, although it can also be a symbol of finding agreement with an ordinary friend or even two conflicting elements within. In the Persona franchise, these two elements are often brought together: the representative will be facing a hard decision within herself as well as being the \"canonical\" love interest of the main character.\n\nThe Lovers symbolize:\n\tDecision\n\tSeparation\n\tLove",
"Chariot":"Portrayed as a king leading a chariot made up of two differently colored horses (in some cases mythical creatures).

"Justice":"Portrayed as a woman holding a sword and balance, the Justice Arcana symbolizes a strict allegory of justice, objectivity, rationality and analysis.

"Hermit":"Portrayed as an old man in a dark place or cave, holding up a lantern, the Hermit is associated with wisdom, introspection, solitude, retreat and philosophical searches.

As Nyx puts it: \"It requires great courage to look at oneself honestly, and forge one's own path...\".\n\nThe Hermit symbolizes:\n\tPhilosophy\n\tSolitude\n\tWisdom",
"Fortune":"Portrayed as a wheel with different animals wearing wealthy and beggarly clothes up and down the wheel, the Fortune arcana symbolizes Fate and varying luck, fortunes and opportunities. What goes up will go down, what goes down will go up. Bearers of the Fortune Arcana are usually individuals who are aware of their fates, and attempt to seize their own destiny in spite of their seemingly-locked fates. Thus, they are typically involved with making important choices and decisions. Interestingly, the symbol of the Fortune arcana was initially inspired by the Zodiac.\n\nFortune symbolizes:\n\tFate\n\tLuck\n\tOpportunity",
"Strength":"Portrayed as a young woman holding up a terrifying beast (more often a lion), the Strength arcana symbolizes an imagery beyond the Beast And Beauty, and is associated with the morality about the stronger power of self-control, gentleness, courage and virtue over brute force.

Sometimes realizing this, sometimes not, they are caught in between to opposing parties and sometimes sacrifice themselves for peace.\n\nThe Hanged Man symbolizes:\n\tDoom\n\tSacrifice\n\tRenewal",
"Death":"While it is associated with foreboding and of doom, Death arcana also symbolizes the metamorphosis and deep change, regeneration and cycles. In recent times, characters of the Death arcana are associated directly with death, but a commonality that connects all Death arcana characters is the cycles of change they experience.

Death awaits you\".\n\nDeath symbolizes:\n\tDeath\n\tCircle of life\n\tFinality",
"Temperance":"Portrayed as a woman with angel wings mixing up the water of two cups, one blue, the other red, the Temperance Arcana is a symbol of synthesis, prudence, harmony, and the merging of opposites.

Hobbies or responsibilities that force them to continually tend to one matter.\n\nTemperance symbolizes:\n\tBalance\n\tResponsibility\n\tHarmony",

Attitude which usually changes over the course of the social link.\n\nThe Devil symbolizes:\n\tSin\n\tImpulsion\n\tDominance",
"Tower":"Portrayed as a tower stricken by lightning, from which two small figures fall down; a straight Tower of Babel allegory about pride preceding the fall.

Furthermore, it is also more generically used as an omen of doom and disaster. It is the \"worst\" arcana, foreboding even worse than death. Its characters are usually people who have fallen from position of respect; they could have fallen from grace.\n\nThe Tower symbolizes:\n\tArrogance\n\tDisaster\n\tFall from grace",
"Star":"The Star arcana is also commonly associated with hope, self-confidence, faith, altruism, luck, generosity, peace and joy. Usually a futile one. An \"acceptance\", or sorts, of their destiny and a continuation of their good faith. As Margaret put it: \"It's a strong card, one that gives hope to those on the ground below. It shines in times of need. But, eventually, it is destined to fall to the earth and disappear...\"\n\nThe Star symbolizes:\n\tGenerosity\n\tGood faith\n\tHopefulness",
"Moon":"Portrayed as two dogs howling at the Moon around a pool with a lobster in it, with two towers in the background, the Moon Arcana is associated with creativity, inspiration, dreams, madness, illusions, fear, fantasy, the subconscious and trickery. In tarot readings, it can also represent being attuned subconsciously to the world around, gaining the ability to sense things without being told about them or without anyone else knowing (which means that some identify this Arcana with psychic energy, be it actual ESP or fraud).\n\nThe Moon symbolizes:\n\tPsyche\n\tInsanity\n\tFantasy",
"Sun":"Portrayed as two children holding hands under a blazing sun, The Sun symbolizes happiness, joy, energy, optimism, and accomplishment. Occasionally, it is also associated with one's initial happiness, in other words the happiness of youth and innocence.

"Judgement":"The Judgement arcana, in tarot, is associated with realizing one's calling, gaining a deep understanding of life, and a feeling of acceptance and absolution.

This arcana is strictly reserved for the story of the game. It WILL be included in the game, however you should not modify it. Your modifications to this social link will not be considered.\n\nJudgement symbolizes:\n\tEnlightenment\n\tUltimate destiny\n\tPerfection",
"Aeon":"The Aeon arcana is in fact simply the judgement arcana, however its name comes from the Aelph tarot deck as opposed to the Thoth deck used for every other arcana. The Judgement arcana, in tarot, is associated with realizing one's calling, gaining a deep understanding of life, and a feeling of acceptance and absolution.
